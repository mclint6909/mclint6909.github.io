Status Update 28/01/2021:

Hey Guys! Hope everyone's doing well. I'm happy to announce the release of Havoc•OS 4.1 based on Android 11. Source code for the same has been pushed to our GitHub (https://github.com/Havoc•OS).

We've also created a website for this project. Thanks to @Irongfly

The URL for our Official website is https://havoc•os.com

Since a lot of our users were having issues with downloading the ROM for SourceForge so we've rented a file hosting server which will let you download the ROM at high speeds without any interruptions. The  same can be accessed at https://download.havoc•os.com.

Another thing that's new is our Gerrit Code Review. Visit https://review.havoc•os.com to participate in the development of this ROM. Thanks to @IronGFly for setting up the downloads site and Gerrit.

Havoc•OS 4.1 builds will start rolling out soon for some devices. Please do not needlessly tag admins or ask for updates for your device. If it's ready then it'll be released. Note that a clean flash is required when switching from Havoc•OS 3.x or any other ROM. Happy Flashing!
